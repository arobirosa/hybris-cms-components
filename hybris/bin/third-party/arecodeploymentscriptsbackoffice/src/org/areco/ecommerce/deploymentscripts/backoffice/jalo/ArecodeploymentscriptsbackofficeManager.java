   * Some important tips for development:
   *
   * Do NEVER use the default constructor of manager's or items. => If you want to do something whenever the manger is created
   * use the init() or destroy() methods described below
   *
   * Do NEVER use STATIC fields in your manager or items! => If you want to cache anything in a "static" way, use an instance
   * variable in your manager, the manager is created only once in the lifetime of a "deployment" or tenant.
